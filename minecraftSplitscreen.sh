# Minecraft Splitscreen Launcher for Steam Deck & Linux
# =============================
# This script launches 1–4 Minecraft instances in splitscreen mode.
# On Steam Deck Game Mode, it launches a nested KDE Plasma session for clean splitscreen.
# On desktop mode, it launches Minecraft instances directly.
# Handles controller detection, per-instance mod config, KDE panel hiding/restoring, and reliable autostart in a nested session.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. If in Steam Deck Game Mode, launches a nested Plasma Wayland session (if not already inside).
# 2. Sets up an autostart .desktop file to re-invoke itself inside the nested session.
# 3. Detects how many controllers are connected (1–4, with Steam Input quirks handled).
# 4. For each player, writes the correct splitscreen mod config and launches a Minecraft instance.
# 5. Hides KDE panels for a clean splitscreen experience (by killing plasmashell), then restores them.
# 6. Logs out of the nested session when done.
#
# NOTE: This script is robust and heavily commented for clarity and future maintainers!
# The main script file should be named minecraftSplitscreen.sh for clarity and version-agnostic usage.

# Set a temporary directory for intermediate files (used for wrappers, etc)
