# Minecraft Splitscreen Steam Deck & Linux Installer

This project provides an easy way to set up splitscreen Minecraft on Steam Deck and Linux using an optimized dual-launcher approach. It supports 1–4 players, controller detection, and seamless integration with Steam Game Mode and your desktop environment.

## Features
- **Optimized Installation:** Uses PrismLauncher for automated instance creation, then switches to PollyMC for gameplay
- Launch 1–4 Minecraft instances in splitscreen mode with proper Fabric support
- Automatic controller detection and per-player config
- Works on Steam Deck (Game Mode & Desktop Mode) and any Linux PC
- Optionally adds a launcher to Steam and your desktop menu
- Handles KDE/Plasma quirks for a clean splitscreen experience when running from Game Mode
- Self-updating launcher script
- **Fabric Loader:** Complete dependency chain implementation ensures mods load and function correctly
- **Smart Cleanup:** Automatically removes temporary files and directories after successful setup

## Requirements
- **Java 21** (OpenJDK 21)
- Linux (Steam Deck or any modern distro)
- Internet connection for initial setup
- *Steam Deck users: For proper controller counting, you must disable the built-in Steam Deck controller when an external controller is connected. See [Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller).*

## Installation Process
The installer uses an **optimized hybrid approach** combining the strengths of two different launchers:

### Why the Hybrid Approach?

Both launchers are essentially the same program with one key difference:

**PrismLauncher** has excellent automation but requires Minecraft licenses:
- ✅ **Excellent CLI automation** - Reliable command-line instance creation
- ✅ **Robust Fabric integration** - Proper mod loader dependency chains
- ❌ **Requires Minecraft license** - Must link a paid Microsoft account before creating offline accounts

**PollyMC** is identical but doesn't require licenses:
- ✅ **No license verification** - Can create offline accounts immediately without any Microsoft account linking
- ❌ **No CLI automation** - Manual setup required for instances

### Our Solution: Best of Both Worlds

1. **PrismLauncher CLI** - For automated instance creation with proper Fabric setup
2. **PollyMC** - For splitscreen gameplay (no forced login, offline-friendly)
3. **Smart Cleanup** - Removes PrismLauncher after successful PollyMC setup

This hybrid approach ensures reliable automated installation while providing the optimal splitscreen gaming experience.

## Installation
1. **Install Java 21**
   - **For Steam Deck users (recommended):**
     ```sh
     # Download and run the Steam Deck JDK installer script
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlackCorsair/install-jdk-on-steam-deck/master/scripts/install-jdk.sh
     chmod +x install-jdk.sh
     JDK_VERSION=21 ./install-jdk.sh
     ```
     This script will install Java 21 to `~/.local/jdk/` and is designed specifically for Steam Deck's read-only filesystem.
   
   - **For other Linux distributions:**
     - For Arch: `sudo pacman -S jdk21-openjdk`
     - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre`
     - Refer to your distro's documentation or package manager for other distributions.

2. **Install Python 3 (optional)**
   - Only required if you want to add the launcher to Steam automatically
   - Most Linux distributions include Python 3 by default
   - For Arch: `sudo pacman -S python`
   - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3`

3. **Download and run the installer:**
   - You can get the latest installer script from the [Releases section](https://github.com/FlyingEwok/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/releases) (recommended for stable versions), or use the latest development version with:
   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlyingEwok/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/main/install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   chmod +x install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   ./install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to customize your installation:
   - **Minecraft version:** Choose your preferred version or press Enter for the latest stable release (1.21.5 recommended for best mod compatibility)
   - **Mod selection process:** The installer will automatically:
     - Search for compatible Fabric versions of all supported mods
     - Filter out incompatible versions using Modrinth and CurseForge APIs
     - Download dependency mods (like Fabric API for most mods)
     - Handle mod conflicts and suggest alternatives when needed
     - Show progress for each mod download with success/failure status
     - Report any missing mods at the end if compatible versions aren't found
   - **Steam integration (optional):** 
     - Choose "y" to add a shortcut to Steam for easy access from Game Mode on Steam Deck
     - Choose "n" if you prefer to launch manually or don't use Steam
   - **Desktop launcher (optional):**
     - Choose "y" to create a desktop shortcut and add to your applications menu
     - Choose "n" if you only want to launch from Steam or manually
   - **Installation progress:** The installer will show detailed progress including:
     - PrismLauncher download and CLI verification
     - Instance creation (4 separate Minecraft instances for splitscreen)
     - PollyMC download and configuration
     - Mod downloads with Fabric compatibility verification
     - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

5. **Steam Deck only - Install Steam Deck controller auto-disable (required):**
   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller/main/curl_install.sh | bash
   ```
   This automatically disables the built-in Steam Deck controller when external controllers are connected, which is essential for proper splitscreen controller counting. **This step is only needed on Steam Deck.**

## Technical Details
- **Mod Compatibility:** Uses both Modrinth and CurseForge APIs with Fabric filtering (`modLoaderType=4` for CurseForge, `.loaders[] == "fabric"` for Modrinth)
- **Instance Management:** Dynamic verification and registration of created instances
- **Error Recovery:** Enhanced error handling with automatic fallbacks and manual creation options
- **Memory Optimization:** Configured for splitscreen performance (3GB max, 512MB min per instance)

## Usage
- Launch the game from Steam, your desktop menu, or the generated desktop shortcut.
- The script will detect controllers and launch the correct number of Minecraft instances.
- On Steam Deck Game Mode, it will use a nested KDE session for best compatibility.
- **Steam Deck users:** For proper controller counting, you must disable the built-in Steam Deck controller when an external controller is connected. Use [Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller) to automate this process.

## Installation Locations
- **Primary installation:** `~/.local/share/PollyMC/` (instances, launcher, and game files)
- **Temporary files:** Automatically cleaned up after successful installation
- **Launcher script:** `~/.local/share/PollyMC/minecraftSplitscreen.sh`

## Troubleshooting
- **Java 21 not found:**
  - Make sure you have Java 21 installed and available in your PATH.
  - See the error message for a link to this README.
- **Controller issues:**
  - Make sure controllers are connected before launching.

## Updating
The launcher script (`minecraftSplitscreen.sh`) will auto-update itself when a new version is available.

## Uninstall
- Delete the PollyMC folder: `rm -rf ~/.local/share/PollyMC`
- Remove any desktop or Steam shortcuts you created.
