# Minecraft Splitscreen Steam Deck & Linux Installer

This project provides an easy way to set up splitscreen Minecraft on Steam Deck and Linux using an optimized dual-launcher approach. It supports 1–4 players, controller detection, and seamless integration with Steam Game Mode and your desktop environment.

## Features
- **Automatic Java Installation:** Detects required Java version and installs automatically (no manual setup required)
- **Optimized Installation:** Uses PrismLauncher for automated instance creation, then switches to PollyMC for gameplay
- Launch 1–4 Minecraft instances in splitscreen mode with proper Fabric support
- Automatic controller detection and per-player config
- Works on Steam Deck (Game Mode & Desktop Mode) and any Linux PC
- Optionally adds a launcher to Steam and your desktop menu
- Handles KDE/Plasma quirks for a clean splitscreen experience when running from Game Mode
- Self-updating launcher script
- **Fabric Loader:** Complete dependency chain implementation ensures mods load and function correctly
- **Automatic Dependency Resolution:** Uses live API calls to discover and install all mod dependencies without manual maintenance
- **Smart Cleanup:** Automatically removes temporary files and directories after successful setup

## Requirements
- Linux (Steam Deck or any modern distro)
- Internet connection for initial setup
- **Java** (automatically installed if not present - no manual setup required)
- *Steam Deck users: For proper controller counting, you must disable the built-in Steam Deck controller when an external controller is connected. See [Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller).*

## Installation Process
The installer uses an **optimized hybrid approach** combining the strengths of two different launchers:

### Why the Hybrid Approach?

Both launchers are essentially the same program with one key difference:

**PrismLauncher** has excellent automation but requires Minecraft licenses:
- ✅ **Excellent CLI automation** - Reliable command-line instance creation
- ✅ **Robust Fabric integration** - Proper mod loader dependency chains
- ❌ **Requires Minecraft license** - Must link a paid Microsoft account before creating offline accounts

**PollyMC** is identical but doesn't require licenses:
- ✅ **No license verification** - Can create offline accounts immediately without any Microsoft account linking
- ❌ **No CLI automation** - Manual setup required for instances

### Our Solution: Best of Both Worlds

1. **PrismLauncher CLI** - For automated instance creation with proper Fabric setup
2. **PollyMC** - For splitscreen gameplay (no forced login, offline-friendly)
3. **Smart Cleanup** - Removes PrismLauncher after successful PollyMC setup

This hybrid approach ensures reliable automated installation while providing the optimal splitscreen gaming experience.

- **Fallback mechanisms:** Manual instance creation if CLI fails, with multiple retry strategies
- **Smart cleanup:** Automatically removes temporary PrismLauncher files after successful PollyMC setup

## Installation
1. **Download and run the installer:**
   - You can get the latest installer script from the [Releases section](https://github.com/mitch000001/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/releases) (recommended for stable versions), or use the latest development version with:
   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitch000001/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/main/install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   chmod +x install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   ./install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   ```

   **Note:** The installer will automatically detect which Java version you need based on your selected Minecraft version and install it if not present. No manual Java setup required!

2. **Install Python 3 (optional)**
   - Only required if you want to add the launcher to Steam automatically
   - Most Linux distributions include Python 3 by default
   - For Arch: `sudo pacman -S python`
   - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3`

3. **Follow the prompts** to customize your installation:
   - **Java installation:** The installer will automatically:
     - Detect the required Java version for your chosen Minecraft version (Java 8, 16, 17, or 21)
     - Search for existing Java installations on your system
     - Download and install the correct Java version automatically if not found (using [install-jdk-on-steam-deck](https://github.com/FlyingEwok/install-jdk-on-steam-deck))
     - Configure environment variables and validate the installation
   - **Minecraft version:** Choose your preferred version from a curated list of versions that are fully compatible with both required splitscreen mods (Controllable and Splitscreen Support), or press Enter for the latest compatible version
   - **Mod selection process:** The installer will automatically:
     - Search for compatible Fabric versions of all supported mods
     - Filter out incompatible versions using Modrinth and CurseForge APIs
     - Automatically resolve and download all mod dependencies using live API calls
     - Download dependency mods (like Fabric API for most mods) without manual specification
     - Handle mod conflicts and suggest alternatives when needed
     - Show progress for each mod download with success/failure status
     - Report any missing mods at the end if compatible versions aren't found
   - **Steam integration (optional):**
     - Choose "y" to add a shortcut to Steam for easy access from Game Mode on Steam Deck
     - Choose "n" if you prefer to launch manually or don't use Steam
   - **Desktop launcher (optional):**
     - Choose "y" to create a desktop shortcut and add to your applications menu
     - Choose "n" if you only want to launch from Steam or manually
   - **Installation progress:** The installer will show detailed progress including:
     - PrismLauncher download and CLI verification
     - Instance creation (4 separate Minecraft instances for splitscreen)
     - PollyMC download and configuration
     - Automatic Java version detection and installation (if needed)
     - Mod downloads with Fabric compatibility verification
     - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

5. **Steam Deck only - Install Steam Deck controller auto-disable (required):**
   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller/main/curl_install.sh | bash
   ```
   This automatically disables the built-in Steam Deck controller when external controllers are connected, which is essential for proper splitscreen controller counting. **This step is only needed on Steam Deck.**

## Technical Details
- **Mod Compatibility:** Uses both Modrinth and CurseForge APIs with Fabric filtering (`modLoaderType=4` for CurseForge, `.loaders[] == "fabric"` for Modrinth)
- **Instance Management:** Dynamic verification and registration of created instances
- **Error Recovery:** Enhanced error handling with automatic fallbacks and manual creation options
- **Memory Optimization:** Configured for splitscreen performance (3GB max, 512MB min per instance)

## Usage
- Launch the game from Steam, your desktop menu, or the generated desktop shortcut.
- The script will detect controllers and launch the correct number of Minecraft instances.
- On Steam Deck Game Mode, it will use a nested KDE session for best compatibility.
- **Steam Deck users:** For proper controller counting, you must disable the built-in Steam Deck controller when an external controller is connected. Use [Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller) to automate this process.

## Installation Locations
- **Primary installation:** `~/.local/share/PollyMC/` (instances, launcher, and game files)
- **Temporary files:** Automatically cleaned up after successful installation
- **Launcher script:** `~/.local/share/PollyMC/minecraftSplitscreen.sh`

## Troubleshooting
- **Java installation issues:**
  - The installer automatically handles Java installation, but if issues occur:
  - Ensure you have an internet connection for downloading Java
  - For manual installation, the installer will provide specific instructions for your system
  - Steam Deck users can use the [install-jdk-on-steam-deck](https://github.com/FlyingEwok/install-jdk-on-steam-deck) script separately if needed
- **Controller issues:**
  - Make sure controllers are connected before launching.

- **Smart Cleanup:** Automatically removes temporary build files and directories after successful setup
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Multiple fallback mechanisms and retry strategies for robust installation

## TODO
- **Figure out a way to handle steam deck controller without needing to disable it for the whole system** - Find a method to selectively disable the Steam Deck controller only for splitscreen sessions while keeping it available for other games, and somehow figure out how to use Steam Deck controller with other controllers at the same time, as well as have the usecase with no Steam Deck controller at all and just the external controllers
- **Figure out preconfiguring controllers within controllable (if possible)** - Investigate automatic controller assignment configuration to avoid having Controllable grab the same controllers as all the other instances, ensuring each player gets their own dedicated controller

## Recent Improvements
- ✅ **Automatic Java Installation**: No manual Java setup required - the installer automatically detects, downloads, and installs the correct Java version for your chosen Minecraft version
- ✅ **Automatic Java Version Detection**: Automatically detects and uses the correct Java version for each Minecraft version (Java 8, 16, 17, or 21) with smart backward compatibility
- ✅ **Intelligent Version Selection**: Only Minecraft versions supported by both Controllable and Splitscreen Support mods are offered to users, ensuring full compatibility
- ✅ **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: No more hardcoded dependency lists - all mod dependencies are detected via API
- ✅ **Robust CurseForge Integration**: Full CurseForge API support with authentication and download URL resolution
- ✅ **Mixed Platform Support**: Seamlessly handles both Modrinth and CurseForge mods in the same installation
- ✅ **Smart Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
