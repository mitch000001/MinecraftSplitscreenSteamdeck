# Minecraft Splitscreen Steam Deck Installer - Steam Integration Module
# =============================================================================
#
# This module handles the integration of Minecraft Splitscreen launcher with
# Steam, providing native Steam library integration, Big Picture mode support,
# and Steam Deck Game Mode integration.
#
# Functions provided:
# - setup_steam_integration: Add Minecraft Splitscreen launcher to Steam library
#
# =============================================================================

# setup_steam_integration: Add Minecraft Splitscreen launcher to Steam library
#
# STEAM INTEGRATION BENEFITS:
# - Launch directly from Steam's game library interface
# - Access from Steam Big Picture mode (ideal for Steam Deck)
# - Controller support through Steam Input system
# - Game Mode integration on Steam Deck
# - Professional appearance with custom artwork
# - Consistent with other Steam games in library
#
# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
# 1. Detects active Steam installation and user data
# 2. Safely shuts down Steam to modify shortcuts database
# 3. Creates backup of existing shortcuts for safety
# 4. Uses specialized Python script to modify binary shortcuts.vdf format
# 5. Downloads custom artwork from SteamGridDB for professional appearance
# 6. Restarts Steam with new shortcut available
#
# SAFETY MEASURES:
# - Checks for existing shortcut to prevent duplicates
# - Creates backup before modifications
# - Uses official Steam binary format handling
# - Handles multiple Steam installation types (native, Flatpak)
