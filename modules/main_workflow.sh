# Minecraft Splitscreen Steam Deck Installer - Main Workflow Module
# =============================================================================
#
# This module contains the main orchestration logic for the complete splitscreen
# installation process. It coordinates all the other modules and provides
# comprehensive status reporting and user guidance.
#
# Functions provided:
# - main: Primary function that orchestrates the complete installation process
#
# =============================================================================

# main: Primary function that orchestrates the complete splitscreen installation process
#
# INSTALLATION WORKFLOW:
# 1. WORKSPACE SETUP: Create directories and initialize environment
# 2. CORE SETUP: Java detection, PrismLauncher download, CLI verification
# 3. VERSION DETECTION: Minecraft and Fabric version determination
# 4. ACCOUNT SETUP: Download offline splitscreen player accounts
# 5. MOD COMPATIBILITY: Query APIs and determine compatible mod versions
# 6. USER SELECTION: Interactive mod selection interface
# 7. INSTANCE CREATION: Create 4 splitscreen instances with PrismLauncher CLI
# 8. LAUNCHER OPTIMIZATION: Setup PollyMC and cleanup PrismLauncher (if successful)
# 9. INTEGRATION: Optional Steam and desktop launcher integration
# 10. COMPLETION: Summary report and usage instructions
#
# ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:
# - Each phase has fallback mechanisms to ensure installation can complete
# - Non-critical failures (like PollyMC setup) don't halt the entire process
# - Comprehensive error reporting helps users understand any issues
# - Multiple validation checkpoints ensure data integrity
#
# DUAL-LAUNCHER APPROACH:
# The script uses an optimized strategy combining two launchers:
# - PrismLauncher: CLI automation for reliable instance creation with proper Fabric setup
# - PollyMC: Offline-friendly gameplay launcher without forced authentication
# - Smart cleanup: Removes PrismLauncher after successful PollyMC setup to save space
