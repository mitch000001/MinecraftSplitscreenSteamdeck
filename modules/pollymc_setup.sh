# Minecraft Splitscreen Steam Deck Installer - PollyMC Setup Module
# =============================================================================
#
# This module handles the setup and optimization of PollyMC as the primary
# launcher for splitscreen gameplay, providing better offline support and
# handling of multiple simultaneous instances compared to PrismLauncher.
#
# Functions provided:
# - setup_pollymc: Configure PollyMC as the primary splitscreen launcher
# - setup_pollymc_launcher: Configure splitscreen launcher script for PollyMC
# - cleanup_prism_launcher: Clean up PrismLauncher files after PollyMC setup
#
# =============================================================================

# setup_pollymc: Configure PollyMC as the primary launcher for splitscreen gameplay
#
# POLLYMC ADVANTAGES FOR SPLITSCREEN:
# - No forced Microsoft login requirements (offline-friendly)
# - Better handling of multiple simultaneous instances
# - Cleaner interface without authentication popups
# - More stable for automated controller-based launching
#
# PROCESS OVERVIEW:
# 1. Download PollyMC AppImage from GitHub releases
# 2. Migrate all instances from PrismLauncher to PollyMC
# 3. Copy offline accounts configuration
# 4. Test PollyMC compatibility and functionality
# 5. Set up splitscreen launcher script for PollyMC
# 6. Clean up PrismLauncher files to save space
#
# FALLBACK STRATEGY:
# If PollyMC fails at any step, we fall back to PrismLauncher
# This ensures the installation completes successfully regardless
